NOTES:
Zombie are attracted to noise so be weary of that or you may attract the horde. Manage your survivors so they won't shoot when you don't want them to. (Remember that you can apply tasks to all survivors at once).  
This IS a survival mod, so food and sleep need to be managed, make sure you hunt for food and loot for resources regularly so you can stay alive in this cold new world.  
If you run into a "friendly" group, try not to shoot at them. During a zombie apocalypse there is no such thing as being civil.  
Build up your camp, and recruit new survivors. Remember that you can tell them to stay behind and "Chill" if needed.  
Manage weapons you share with your group. After all, weapons are the key to having the upper hand against dangerous enemies.  
Craft walls and barricades to keep zombies from entering your safe zone.  

The menu key-codes are editable in the .ini file that is created after you run the game with the mod.
